# Pitch Perfect

An iPhone app that will allow users to record their voice and will then modulate the recorded audio to sound like a Chipmunk or Darth Vader. This app will also let the user speed up or slow down the rate of playback, and experience fun echo and reverb effects.

### For this project, I have :

- Created a new project from existing iOS app templates
- Added buttons, images, labels and create user interfaces for the app using the Storyboard
- Leveraged the Model View Controller (MVC) design principles; this includes writing custom model code, and using UIViewController, and UIView
- Created Outlet and Action connections between the views and view controllers. Benefit from the power of Delegates by using them in code
- Navigated between two scenes in the app using UINavigationController
- Play audio files using AVFoundation’s AVAudioEngine class
- Ran the iOS simulator and download the app on a physical device
- Searched documentation, resolve bugs, and read other people’s code
- made the app look great in both portrait and landscape modes
